# Data_Collection-challenge


In the **Starter_Code** folder are stored the following files:
1. The **mars_data.csv**, holding the data that was scraped by the the script **Update part_2_mars_weather.ipynb**
2. The **part_1_mars_news.ipynb** file. This script will retrive the title and the preview of the articles stored in the page https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_news/index.html
3. Lastly the **part_2_mars_weather.ipynb** file. The script in this file will retrive the data held in the https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_facts/temperature.html store it in a dataframe in order to run the analysis required and plot the minimum temperatures and atmosferic pressure related to the different months and also the minimum temperature related to the heart day.


All the code was made by me by consulting the class materials and stack overflow.
